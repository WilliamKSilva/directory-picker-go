# Dependencies
- Go toolchain installed

# How to build
- Clone this repo
- `go build`
- Add an alias on your .bashrc or .zshrc: 
    `alias dp='sudo PATH-TO-REPO/directory-picker-go/directory-picker-go && source PATH-TO-REPO/directory-picker-go/change-directory.sh'`

# Next steps
- Record basic video showing the current state of the TUI 
- Add better docs showing how to install and run the TUI without
the need of building from source
- Most visited directories show up at the top of the list
- Some basic customization (dont want the TUI to be so bloated)
